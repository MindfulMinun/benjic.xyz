## Education

I attended [Legacy ECHS][lechs] in Taylor, Texas. I was enrolled in dual credit courses and graduated with an associate’s degree from Temple College in May 2019. I was 17 years old when I graduated. Then, I studied at UT Dallas, and received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in December 2022.

While at UT Dallas, I enrolled in several courses that helped me develop my skills as a software engineer, including the following:

- Linear Algebra
- Discrete Mathematics
- Algorithm Analysis and Data Structures
- Computer and Network Security
- Computer Networks
- Automata Theory
- Artificial Intelligence
- Digital Forensics

</details>

I thoroughly enjoyed these courses; they're the cornerstone of my career. Computer Science is the field that combines applied mathematics and creativity to solve problems, and I love it. I love the challenge of solving problems, and I love the satisfaction of having a clever working solution expressed in code.

## Team development experience

Along with my coursework, I took advantage of other opportunities to work on team projects. In <time datetime="2021-11-13" title="Nov 13, 2021">my junior year of uni</time>, I participated in the [HackUTD VIII hackathon][hackutd-8], where I collaborated with a team of four to create a full-stack web application prototype that monitors the congestion of people at busy areas at the university. The prototype, named [UTD Singularity][singularity], was completed successfully in under 24 hours [(source code)][singularity-src].

I also participated in a game jam in <time datetime="2022-02-21" title="Feb 21, 2022">February 2022</time>, where I partnered with a group of six to create a story-driven platformer using the Unity engine. My diverse skills enabled me to contribute to player and enemy programming, UI, animation & level design, and music composition. The game, named [Drawn to Reality][drawn-2-reality-src], was ~~completed successfully~~ in under one week.

## Professional experience

While I was in <time datetime="2020-10" title="October 2020">my sophomore year of uni</time>, I was invited to the *Accelerate with Adobe Career Readiness Program*, where I honed my skills via workshops, résumé building, mock interviews, and presentations from Adobe leadership. Out of over a hundred participants, I was one of four to receive internship offers.

I interned with Adobe over the summers of 2021 (remotely) and 2022 (hybrid), working as a Software Engineer Intern on the Adobe Commerce team.

I accepted my first full-time offer from Adobe in mid-2022, and I've been working for Adobe since January of 2023.
