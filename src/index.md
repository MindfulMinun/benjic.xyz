# Hi, I’m Benji. 👋🏽

I’m supposed to be studying.

<section id="intro">

Hi, I’m Benji. You might know me as [@MindfulMinun][Twitter] online. I graduated from [Temple&nbsp;College][templejc] late last spring with an associate’s degree. I’m currently studying at [UT&nbsp;Dallas][utd], majoring in Computer&nbsp;Science. I like to [write&nbsp;code](/p/) and play the piano.

In my free time, I like to write JavaScript. Check out some of the <a href="/p/" class="callout-text">things&nbsp;I’ve&nbsp;made</a>, I promise you they’re *(kinda)* cool.

<section id="code">

I love to code. It’s my dream to write code for a living. I picked up JavaScript during my freshman year of high school while messing around with Firefox Scratchpad. I naturally went on to learn the other two web languages, HTML and CSS. Over the course of these 5 years, I’ve become fluent in front-end workflow, combining technologies ranging from CI with Heroku and Netlify, GitHub Actions, integration with Visual&nbsp;Studio Code, backends in Node.js with Express, you name it.
