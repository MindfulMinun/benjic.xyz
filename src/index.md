# Hi, I’m Benji. 👋🏽

I’m supposed to be studying.

Hi, I’m Benji. You might know me as [@MindfulMinun][Twitter] online. I graduated from [Temple&nbsp;College][templejc] late last spring with an associate’s degree. I’m currently a first-year at [UT&nbsp;Dallas][utd], majoring in Computer&nbsp;Science. I like to [write&nbsp;code](/p/) and play the piano.


In my free time, I like to write JavaScript. Check out some of the <a href="/p/" class="callout-text">things&nbsp;I’ve&nbsp;made</a>, I promise you they’re *(kinda)* cool.

        /static/images/retrato-1-1-tiny.jpeg 612w,
        /static/images/retrato-1-1-small.webp 1224w,
        /static/images/retrato-1-1-small.jpeg 1224w,

        /static/images/retrato-1-1.jpeg 2448w
    ",
    src="/static/images/retrato-1-1.jpeg",
    sizes="(min-width: 560px) 480px, 100vw",
    ratio="1",
    id="me",
    style="background: #306bad;"
%}

I love to code. It’s my dream to write code for a living. I picked up JavaScript during my freshman year of high school while messing around with Firefox Scratchpad. I naturally went on to learn the other two web languages, HTML and CSS. After 5 years, I’ve become fluent in front-end workflow, combining technologies ranging from client-side ServiceWorker to back-end Heroku, you name it.
